- RVC settings access, without RVC already displayed: user clicks on control
  center icon.

#### Quick AVM flows recap

**In Bold** are the not correctly handled use cases or questions/open points.

##### AVM digital popup

- AVM Pop-up opening due to UPA/FKP obstacle

  - Sonar send a display request to AVM ECU
  - AVM send Pop-up Layout request to IVI

- AVM Pop-up closing due to Sonar Request
- AVM Pop-up closing due to user request by pushing Close Popup button

##### AVM Digital Views

- AVM Opening due to user request by pushing AVM button
- AVM User Activation when AVM PopUp already displayed
  - **Pop-up windows shall be closed**
- AVM User Activation after user closed AVM popup
  - **AVM should be opened with no UPA sound (no visible Button - no overlay is
    mentionned in the doc - or just muted by default?**
  - **if another pop-up request is then sent, AVM screen should remain but with
    sound activated + overlays(?)**
- AVM User Activation but AVM conditions speed NOK - usecase 1
  - **There is notion of user push and user release sw button not clearly
    defined.**
  - **Interpretation:**
    - **AVM application should not be launched at all if conditions are not
      met.** _May feels a little buggy to user_
    - **AVM app is launched only if conditions are met and there is more than 3s
      between successive user push on the button**
  - **What is the "AVM msg: Speed NOK"? A pop display for user or is it just
    internal to the doc?**
- AVM User Activation but AVM conditions speed NOK but with new push <3s -
  usecase 2a
  - **Interpretation: intervall between push button two short, app still not
    launched**
  - **warning popup message not displayed again**
  - **Warning pop-up duration should not exceed 3s?**
- AVM User Activation but AVM conditions speed NOK but with new push <3s -
  usecase 2b
  - **???**
- AVM User Activation but AVM conditions speed NOK but with new push >3s -
  usecase 3
  - **Interpretation: warning pop-up displayed again if another press done after
    3s**
- AMV Opening due to user request
- View Change due to user request on screen
  - **Transition screen to be handled**
- View change due to AVM request. **means application already launched by
  user?**
  - **Looks like AVM screen still displayed. Does this mean there is no switch
    to overlay mode?**
- Layout change due to user command on screen, _with AVM priority_
  - **Difference seems to be that display status is sent before change request**
- AVM closing due to user request by pushing AVM button
- AVM closing due to AVM ECU Request
  - Ok in regulatory case
  - **in case of AVM beeing opened by the user, no warning messsage?**
- AVM closing but Sonar obstacles still present (AVM popup)
  - **Back to home screen with AVM pop-up**

##### AVM digital settings

- AVM Settings activation in settings menu without RearView displayed before
- AVM settings activation in settings menu, with AVM popup without RearView
  displayed before
  - **pop-up windows shall be closed (even if obstacle still detected?)**
- AVM settings activation in AVM screen without RearView displayed before
- AVM settings activation in AVM screen WITH RearView displayed before.
  **regulatory use case?**
  - **Settings still to be displayed but no distinctions compared with previous
    case regarding overlay mode**
- AVM settings FV deactivation, after settings activation in settings menu due
  to Back button
  - Go back to Home screen
  - **"Launched from setings menu": guess this is is from car control center
    since going back to home screen**
  - **why is FV important?**
- AVM settings FV deactivation, after settings activation in AVM screen due to
  Back button
  - Going back to AVM screen
- AVM settings RV deactivation due to Back button
  - **Assuming that settings launched the same way than previous use case**
  - Back to AVM screen
- AVM settings deactivation & AVM deactivation due to vehicle speed not valid
  - **transition to home page if RESPONSE_TIME_FAILURE**
  - **AVM view with black screen otherwise**
- AVM settings FV deactivation, UPA/FKP obstacles due to Back button
  - Pop-up should be displayed when settings are closed
  - From settings use case 2, we know that settings screen takes priority over
    sonar pop-up

##### APA AVM (FAPK)

- FAPk activation without AVM/Popup before - _Car Control isonly accessible if
  Neutral/Drive, sowhenAPA activatedFrontViewisdisplayedby default_
- FAPk activation WITH AVM already displayed - _Only possible if APA button is
  available/displayed on AVM screen_
  - **Comment suggest this is with apa bubble capability.**
- FAPk activation when Popup layout already displayed
  - Remove pop-up and display FAPK
- FAPk scan with Front View Masked @High speed
  - APA_ViewMaskRequest true if >12km/h, false otherwise
  - **when true, "FAPk screen With Front View NOT displayedIn Scan mode": does
    this mean FAPK with no camera view or no FAPK screen at all?**
- FAPk Transition Scan/Manoeuvre/ParkOut
  - Depends on APA_MapContentDisplay field
- FAPk deactivation due to USER REQUEST without UPA/FKP obstacles & without
  RearGear Engaged
  - Back to home page
- FAPk deactivation due to USER REQUEST WITH RearGear Engaged
  - **Back to regulatory AVM screen**
- FAPk deactivation due to USER REQUEST WITH UPA/FKP obstacles & without
  RearGear Engaged
  - Back to home with Pop-up
- FAPk deactivation due to AVM REQUEST withoutUPA/FKP obstacles &
  withoutRearGear Engaged
  - Back to home page
- FAPk deactivation due to AVM REQUEST WITH RearGear Engaged
  - Back to AVM regulatory screen
- FAPk deactivation due to AVM REQUEST WITH UPA/FKP obstacles & without RearGear
  Engaged

  - Back to home with Pop-up

##### APA Sonar with AVM Digital (HFP/HFPB/APK)

Many slides mentions some CAN Signal response time conditions. Assumption is
made that this is hanled/filtered at lower layers (SVS) than HMI which then only
respond to SVS requests.

  BV+FV
  - HFP Screen displayed with or without AVM views
